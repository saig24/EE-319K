; Brief description of the program
;   The LED toggles at 8 Hz and a varying duty-cycle
;   Repeat the functionality from Lab2-3 but now we want you to 
;   insert debugging instruments which gather data (state and timing)
;   to verify that the system is functioning as expected.
; Hardware connections (External: One button and one LED)
;  PE1 is Button input  (1 means pressed, 0 means not pressed)
;  PE0 is LED output (1 activates external LED on protoboard)
;  PF2 is Blue LED on Launchpad used as a heartbeat
; Instrumentation data to be gathered is as follows:
; After Button(PE1) press collect one state and time entry. 
; After Buttin(PE1) release, collect 7 state and
; time entries on each change in state of the LED(PE0): 
; An entry is one 8-bit entry in the Data Buffer and one 
; 32-bit entry in the Time Buffer
;  The Data Buffer entry (byte) content has:
;    Lower nibble is state of LED (PE0)
;    Higher nibble is state of Button (PE1)
;  The Time Buffer entry (32-bit) has:
;    24-bit value of the SysTick's Current register (NVIC_ST_CURRENT_R)
; Note: The size of both buffers is 50 entries. Once you fill these
;       entries you should stop collecting data
; The heartbeat is an indicator of the running of the program. 
; On each iteration of the main loop of your program toggle the 
; LED to indicate that your code(system) is live (not stuck or dead).
